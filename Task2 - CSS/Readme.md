## Tasks 2 : Make a `CSS` File
<hr>

You have been provided with site files but a `.CSS` file that gives styling to the website is missinig :)

For Task 2 of your TaskPhase you will have to develop the missing file that matches the styling given in the images (`s1.png` and `s2.png`)

*Best of Luck!*
